## Prerequisite
Make sure that [Node.js][] is installed. It provides the [npm][] command to [install][] [JavaScript][] [packages][] listed in [package-lock.json][], which is automatically updated whenever [package.json][] or the local [node_modules][] is changed. This project depends on only one [JavaScript][] package, [Three.js][]. [Vite][] is needed for the deployment of the project through [GitHub Pages][].
